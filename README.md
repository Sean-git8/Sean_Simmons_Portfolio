Welcome, these are some data analysis exercises I have been working on to keep sharpening my skills.
Please see the 10 Data analytics projects and reports I have done that cycle through the full data analytics life cycle.

Format:

Each project is separated into folders by their main data anlytics life cycle role.

Each folder then has one or more projects labeled as "Tasks" that use specific techniques to provide an analysis and report for a percieved business problem.
