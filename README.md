# Personal-Projects-Portfolio
Welcome, these are some data analysis exercises I have been working on to keep sharpening my skills.
Please see the 10 Data analytics projects and reports I have done that cycle through the full data analytics life cycle.

Format:

Each project has a PDF report and attached data files and code with the same naming system

Example:

For Data Acquisition, there is Data_Acquisition.pdf, Data_Acquisition_servicesfile.csv, and Data_Acquisition_code.ipynb

All of the files with the same or similiar name are related to their respective projects.
